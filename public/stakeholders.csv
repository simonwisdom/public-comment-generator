"Ocean Dumping; Withdrawal of Designated Disposal Sites; Nome, Alaska","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to withdraw the designated ocean dredged material disposal sites, the Nome East and Nome West Sites, located near Nome, Alaska. This action is being taken because the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has not used the sites for disposal of dredged material since 2009 and has no plans for future use. Instead, the USACE has been placing dredged material onshore for beneficial use of beach nourishment, which will continue unaffected by this withdrawal. The EPA is relinquishing management of these sites as they are no longer suitable for USACE's needs.This document is important as it outlines the EPA's administrative action to remove these disposal sites from regulation, which will streamline the dredging operations in the Nome area. The withdrawal is a non-controversial action as there are no anticipated adverse impacts to the marine environment or changes to the disposal options available to the USACE and other interested parties.","['United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)', 'Port of Nome', 'Environmental advocacy groups']","[""The USACE is the primary stakeholder affected by this action, as it had previously used the disposal sites.
